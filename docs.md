## Variables & Assignment   

## `const`
    foo := 'hello'

## Annotated `const`
    foo: string = 'hello'
LightScript uses Facebook's [Flow](flowtype.org) typechecker and type syntax.

## `let`
    let bar := 3
    bar = 4

    let baz
    baz = 4

## Annotated `let`
    let baz: string = 'foo'

    let bar: number
    bar = 3
LightScript uses Facebook's [Flow](flowtype.org) typechecker and type syntax.

## `var`
`var` will probably not be added.

      foo() -> 'hello'
      bar() ->
        'hi there'
    }

## Conditionals

### Basic `if`
    if a === b
      console.log('a is b')

### One-line `if`
    if a !== b: console.log('a isnt b')

    foo(a) ->
      if a.length === 0: return
      # ...

### One-line `if` with early `and return`
    foo(a) ->
      if a.length === 0: console.log('darn') and return
      # ...

### Ternaries
    animal := if canBark: 'dog' else 'cow'

### `null`-default Ternaries 
    animal := if canBark: 'dog'
---
    const animal = canBark ? 'dog' : null;

### Multiline Ternaries (aka `if` expressions)
    animal := if canBark
        'dog'
      else if canMeow
        'cat'
      else 
        'cow'
TBD: if you need the extra indent or not.


## Logic

### or
    c := a || b
TBD: `or` keyword

### and
    c := a && b
TBD: `and` keyword

### not
    not c
TBD: also allowing `!` prefix, and/or removing `not` entirely.
The problem is that `!` is also used in the [bangcall feature]().

### Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators (namely `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`) are not included in the language. Instead, they are [provided as functions]() in the standard library.


## Existentialism

NOTE TO SELF: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20%26%20grammar/ch4.md#comparing-nulls-to-undefineds

## Existential operator
    if a?
      1
---
    if (a != null) 
Note that this does not perform an "undeclared" check, as CoffeeScript does.
If you want to deal with global variables, you must access them from the global object (eg, `window`) directly.
The compiler or linter should catch references to undeclared variables.

### null-or
    c := a ?? b
---
    const c = (a != null ? a : b);

### or-equals
    obj.prop ?= 42
---
    obj.prop = (obj.prop != null ? obj.prop : 42);

### Elvis operator
    d = a?.b?.c
---
    const d = (a != null 
      ? (a.b != null ? a.b.c : null) 
      : null
    );
Note that the default value is `null`, unlike CoffeeScript's `undefined`.

### Safe calls
    if foo?()
      1
---
    if (isFunction(foo) ? foo() : null)
      1
See [the standard library]() for `isFunction` (tl;dr, it comes from lodash).


## Objects and Arrays

### Single-Line Objects
    obj := { a: 'a', b, [1 + 1]: 'two', ...anotherObj }
Destructuring, dynamic names, and splats are the same as in JS.

### Multi-Line Objects
    obj := {
      a: 'a'
      b
      [1 + 1]: 'two'
      ...anotherObj
Commas are not necessary. Using commas in a multiline object raises a linting error. 

More importantly, note that the closing `}` is not required; a dedent is used instead. It is a linting error to use a `}` for an object that is less than Â¿25? lines. It is a linting error not to use a `}` for an object that is longer.

### Nested Objects
    obj := {
      a: 
        a1: 1
        a2: 2
      b: 
        b1: 1
        b2: 2
      c: [
        1
        2
      d: 'd'
Once you have begun an object definition with a `{`, you do not need to close it.

### Destructured Property Transfer
    bar := { a: 1 }
    foo := { b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
    bar{ b, c } = foo
---
    const bar = { a: 1 }
    const foo = { b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
    bar.b = foo.b;
    bar.c = foo.c;

### Single-Line Arrays
    arr := [1 2 3 (5 - 1) 5]
Commas are unnecessary, and raise a linting error. Elements that are expressions must be wrapped in parentheses.

### Multi-Line Arrays
    arr := [
      1 
      2 
      (2 + 1) 
      5 - 1
      5
Again, commas are unnecessary, and raise a linting error. Elements that are expressions no longer need to be wrapped in parentheses, but doing so does not raise a linting error.

### Word Arrays
    words := w[hello world, it's been a while.]
---
    const words = ['hello', 'world,', 'it\'s', 'been', 'a', 'while.'];
Prefixing an array with `w` means all its elements are treated as strings. Interpolation occurs as normal, without 

### Word Arrays with Interpolation
    n := 7
    words := W[hello world, it's been {n}+ years.]
---
    const words = ['hello', 'world,', 'it\'s', 'been', `${n}+`, 'years.'];
To use interpolation within a word array, use an uppercase `W`.

## Classes

### Basic Classes
    class Animal
      talk() -> 'grrr'
    class Person extends Animal
      talk() -> 'hello!'

### Decorators
    @classDecorator
    class Animal
      @methodDecorator
      talk() -> 'grrr'
The same as ES7.

### Shorthand for `this.`
    class Animal
      talk() -> 
        ^noise
---
    class Animal {
      talk() {
        return this.noise
      }
    }
The pin operator `^` can be used as shorthand for `this.` outside of classes as well. 

Note that unlike coffeescript, `^` cannot be used on its own to refer to `this`. So, for example, `return this` must be written instead of `return ^`

### Getters and Setters
    class Animal
      get noise() ->
        ^sound || 'grrr'
      set noise(newValue) ->
        ^sound = newValue

### Class properties ("class instance fields")
    class Animal
      noise = 'grrr'
As in EcmaScript.

### Static properties and methods ("class static fields")
    class Animal
      static isVegetable = false
      static canMakeNoise() -> true
As in EcmaScript.

Note that you cannot use a fat arrow (`=>`) with a static method.

### Pinned constructor params
    class Animal
      constructor(^noise, { limbs: { ^numLimbs } }) ->
---
    class Animal {
      constructor(noise, { limbs: { numLimbs } }) {
        this.noise = noise;
        this.numLimbs = numbLimbs;
      }
    }

### Bound methods
    class MyComponent extends React.Component
      handleClick() =>
        ^setState({ clicked: true })
      render() ->
        <button onClick={^handleClick}>
          Click me!
        </button>
---
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(...args) {
        super(...args);
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
      },
      handleClick({ currentTarget: { value } }) {
        this.setState({ value });
      },
      render() {
        return (
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
            Click me!
          </button>
        );
      }
    }       
Use a fat arrow (`=>`) to bind class methods. This will be added to the constructor after a `super` call, which will be created if it does not exist.


## Switch
Switch statements are not allowed. Use `match` or if-else chains instead. 

This omission is because switch statements tend to be anemic, inconvenient, and confusing. They may be added in the future.


## Numbers

### Underbars
    oneMillionDollars: Cents = 1_000_000_00
---
    const oneMillionDollars: Cents = 100000000;

### Restrictions
- Decimals must be prefixed with a zero (eg, `.9` is not allowed, but `0.9` is). 
- Scientific notation (eg; `10e3` is not allowed).

These restrictions are for clarity, simplicity, and ease of parsing, and may be relaxed in the future. 

## `for` loops

EcmaScript has three kinds of `for` loops; `for-in`, `for-of`, and `for (...;...;...)`. LightScript has three corresponding `for` loops: `for-in`, `for-of`, and `for-from`.

### `for-in`
    for key in obj
      val := obj[key]
As in EcmaScript. 

Using `in` with an Array is usually not what you want, and will raise an error. The type of an interable must therefore be inferrable to be used with `for-in` (ie; you can't do `for key in thing` if `thing` has type `any`).

### `for-in` with value
    for key, value in obj
      console.log(key, value)
---
    for (const key in obj) {
      const value = obj[key];
      console.log(key, value)
    }    

As noted above, cannot be used with Arrays.

### `for-own-in`
    for own key in obj
---
    for (const key in obj) { 
      if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;

    for own key, value in obj
---
    for (const key in obj) { 
      if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;
      const value = obj[key];

As noted above, cannot be used with Arrays.

### `for-of`
    for elem of array
      console.log(elem)

    for val of obj
      console.log(val)

As in EcmaScript.

Note that you can also do this:
    
    for [ index, elem ] of array.entries()

Which is a feature of modern EcmaScript.

### `for-from`

This is the equivalent of EcmaScript's `for (initialization ; haltCondition ; step)` syntax, which while inconvenient, is the most performant and powerful in certain situations.

`for-from` seeks to retain the full expressive power of `for (...;...;...)`, while making all cases more readable and common cases more convenient.

The following are all equivalent to `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`:

    for i from 0 til (i < array.length) step (i++)
    for i from 0 til array.length step 1
    for i from 0 til array.length
    for i from array

### Other examples:

Range: 

    for i from 0 til 10
---
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)

Integer step:

    for i from 0 til 10 step 2
---
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i+= 2)

Step expression:

    for i from 0 til 10 step (i += i * 2)
---
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += i * 2)

Halt Condition expression:

    for i from 0 til (isDone(i)) step (i += i * 2)
---
    for (let i = 0; isDone(i); i += i * 2)

Unfortunately I have not yet thought of a way to customize the initialization beyond a single variable with a single value. If you need more advanced initialization, use the lines preceding the loop.

### `for-from` with value
    for i, elem from array
      console.log(i, elem)
---
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      const elem = array[i];
      console.log(i, elem);

Note that you cannot use this feature in conjunction with `til` or `step`.

Note that this feature is not to be used with Objects, only Arrays; for Objects, see [`for-own-in` with value]().

### `for-from-downTil`
    for i from 10 downTil 0
---
    for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--)

    for i from 10 downTil 0 step 2
---
    for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2)

This feature may not be worth it, and could be removed in the future, since you can do: 

    for i from 10 til (i > 0) step -1

### Single-line `for`
    for elem of collection: console.log(elem)

This syntax can be used with all three kinds of for loops.

Note that you can combine this with single-line `if` statements:
    
    for elem of collection: if elem > 3: console.log(elem)

Note also that multi-line `for` loops may use a trailing colon, but it raises a linter error.

### Comprehensions

This feature is a "maybe", since `map` should typically be used instead. However, there's no convenient and efficient way to iteratively build an object in a one-liner.

Array Comprehensions:

    doubledItems := [ for item of array: item * 2 ]
    filteredItems := [ for item of array: if item > 3: item ]

Object Comprehensions:

    objFromArr := { for i, item from array: "thing_{i}", item }

    objFromObj := { for own key, value in obj: key, value * 2 }
---
    const objFromObj = (() => {
      const returnValue = {};
      for (const key in obj) {
        if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;
        const value = obj[key];
        returnValue[key] = value;
      }
      return returnValue;
    });

The syntax for this is not yet settled.
